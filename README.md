# Airbnb Booking Data in Europe
## Final Capstone for the 30-Day Challenge by [Zindua School](https://zinduaschool.com)
This project involves: database design, data consolidation into an relational databse, as well as data analysis and visualisation of Airbnb bookings data in Europe.

### Data Sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities)
#### About Dataset
This dataset provides a comprehensive look at Airbnb prices in some of the most popular European cities. Each listing is evaluated for various attributes such as room types, cleanliness and satisfaction ratings, bedrooms, distance from the city centre, and more to capture an in-depth understanding of Airbnb prices on both weekdays and weekends. Using spatial econometric methods, we analyse and identify the determinants of Airbnb prices across these cities. 

#### Content
Our dataset includes information such as realSum (the total price of the listing), room_type (private/shared/entire home/apt), host_is_superhost (boolean value indicating if host is a superhost or not), multi (indicator whether listing is for multiple rooms or not), biz (business indicator) , guest_satisfaction_overall (overall rating from guests camparing all listings offered by host ), bedrooms, dist (distance from city center) , lng & lat coordinates for location identification etc. We hope that this data set offers insight into how global markets are affected by social dynamics and geographical factors which in turn determine pricing strategies for optimal profitability!
